## Inspiration

We love art and are deeply interested in crypto and decentralized finance.  
A lot of talented artists struggle to find sustainable ways to fund their work
We wanted to explore how blockchain technology could empower artists **without turning art into pure speculation**.

---

## What It Does

**MTL Minted** is a platform that allows artists to:

- Mint and tokenize their creative identity on the Solana blockchain  
- Release **badges and fractional tokens** for supporters and donors  
- Build a transparent, on-chain history of support and engagement  

Supporters receive digital badges or tokenized shares as a way to **show support**, not to promote pump-and-dump speculation.

---

## How We Built It

- **Blockchain:** Solana  
- **Smart Contracts:** Rust + Anchor  
- **Frontend:** React + Vite  
- **Wallet Integration:** Solana wallets for minting and transaction history  

We set up a local Solana blockchain environment, connected wallets and implemented token minting and transfers entirely on-chain.

## Challenges We Faced

- **Solana setup complexity:**  
  Setting up the Solana development environment for the first time was challenging, especially interacting directly with Rust-based smart contracts.

- **Crypto & art grey areas:**  
  Designing a system around art, NFTs, and tokenization without encouraging speculative behaviour or unethical investment mechanics required careful thought. Maybe too careful (haha time...)

- **Scope management:**  
  Our original vision was far more ambitious than what we could realistically build during the hackathon.

## Accomplishments We’re Proud Of

- Successfully setting up a **local Solana blockchain environment**
- Linking wallets and maintaining **on-chain transaction history**
- Enabling artists to:
  - Mint their own tokens  
  - Sell **fractional tokenized shares** to supporters  

Seeing real transactions work end-to-end was a huge win for us.

## What We Learned

- Don’t bite off more than you can chew
- Blockchain development has a steep learning curve, especially with Rust  
- Simpler, well-executed ideas often beat over-engineered ones  

We learned to adapt quickly and focus on delivering a functional core product.

## What’s Next for Us

- Partnering with **local Montreal artists**  
- Helping artists kickstart projects or receive long-term support  
- Creating better incentives for artists to consistently share content and grow their audience  

Our goal is to build a sustainable, artist-first platform that uses blockchain responsibly.
